Mentioned in the earlier post, all the elements in breakfast have a connector and that is me. The interaction of these elements has different dimensions. Ingredients are simply connected to each other on a plate. How it looks can also trigger memories from the past. It should feel good. The whole ritual has a timeline, I always start the coffee machine first, whilst it’s getting ready I boil my eggs, when they’re boiling I prepare the tomatoes cheese and other ingredients. Eventually, I have all the ingredients in my plate at the same time. This order is also very efficient that I can maximise the time spent on breakfast before going to work or school. Time is connected to this with a controlling effect. How late, changes how quickly it should be. On the other hand, time connects this ritual with another time in the past. The place is affecting what I eat. Hence every place has its own special breakfast. Also, place creates new connections between taste and memories for future breakfasts. So the place is connected to ingredients directly and creates a connection with them. Coffee is absolutely another experience but a breakfast is never done without a good cup of coffee. Coffee always follows breakfast, they are inseparable. Mentioned in the earlier post it is the finish line of the ritual, it is a sign that I can start my day now.

Breakfast is simply an action to stop our hunger. It responds to a basic instinct, ‘to eat’. However, psychologically it means more than that. Breakfast is very important to me, I always spend a certain time to prepare my breakfast. As a counter-thesis, I hear a lot of people do not have breakfast or they just eat a slice of bread in the morning and move on. Obviously, that is something common and very natural. This issue kept me thinking why I am so into breakfast, what is the key point addicts me to it? Whilst I am researching it, I stumbled upon an interview with a famous chef, Bryan Voltaggio. He states “The goal is to create a memorable experience, and one that connects not only me to the diner, but also the diner to a time, or a place, or a memory” (Richardson, 2015). This matches my thoughts on breakfast. Hence there is a different connection between me and breakfast, something more than eliminates hunger.

For my whole life, I was on the go, I had no certain home. Until 18 years of age, I lived in three houses; my parents’, grandparents’ and grandaunts’. Nearly every year I moved from one house to another, after 18 I left my hometown and since then I lived in 5 different cities. I had no home, I was always trying to create a place where I belong to and every time I was wrecking one to build another one. All these homes have their influence on me today. Even they do not exist now, they all live in me, I am who I am because of them. As I mentioned in an earlier post every city has its own delicacies, every home has a special breakfast delight for me. That’s I believe what connects me to breakfast. I had no regular home, instead, I believed home is where I can prepare my own food. Home is where I can have breakfast without worry and hesitation. Thinking of this aspect made everything very clearly.

Today, I cannot say I have a certain type of breakfast or I am very conservative about it. In the end, It is a bit boring to eat the same things every day. I generally eat a boiled egg in my most mornings, I cut it into four and put some spice mix on it. My grandmother was preparing her own mix and I was eating that when I was living with her. In India, I kept doing the same ritual but I discovered chat masala. Now it is a fusion that I use chat masala nearly every morning to honour my grandma and India. Sometimes I prepare Garlic Turkish Sausage in a toast, that reminds me of the Sunday breakfasts that my father prepares.

My whole life and the constant movement brought me here. The connection is undeniable but this is not a simple yearning for a nostalgia. This connection between me and breakfast is starting my every day for with remembering who I am, where I came from. The breakfast ritual is simply me.
