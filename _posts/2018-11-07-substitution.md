When I check the core of this experience it is to eat. It is to feed my hunger in the morning. There are certain ways to do that. One simple way is to grab a bread and eat it with some cheese, it is so effortless that one can finish it in 5 minutes. This action will not need many actors, it will be again me, bread & cheese and a drink. They are all connected right here, right now. Bread & cheese is an inseparable couple, they are altogether their relationship on space might change. They can be on top of each other or bread can cover cheese. A drink is essential to be able to swallow it. A coffee, a tea or a juice it does not matter what it is, the purpose of it is to help the action of eating. There is always a timeline though, Bread & cheese, drink, bread & cheese, drink… Until they finish.

This action will remove the connection of my taste memory and my breakfast. It will still be a meal, it will keep me full for a while but it will not recall any good emotion or it will not make me feel I’m home. It only corresponds to the basic human instincts. A human needs a breakfast to get the necessary nutrition to kickstart the day and a little bread and cheese would provide the necessary nutrients but it is not wrong to claim this action that it is out of soul - at least for me. Nutrition is not only something physical, but our soul also needs some food too. Waking up early in the morning to run a day that you will work or study is already hard enough, why wouldn’t you get some happiness from what you eat. Next time when you are having a breakfast just prepare something that you would eat in the past, your memory will certainly surprise you.
